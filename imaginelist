A Wes Anderson-designed space ship interior with 1960s vibes would likely be colorful, quirky, and carefully curated. The walls might be painted in bold, geometric patterns, with large windows that provide a stunning view of the galaxy outside. The furniture would be a mix of mid-century modern pieces and futuristic designs, with plenty of velvet and brass accents. The ship would be filled with whimsical details, such as vintage space-themed posters, retro appliances, and hidden compartments that reveal secret treasures. The overall aesthetic would be playful and eccentric, with a nod to the nostalgia of the 1960s space race. --ar 3:2
