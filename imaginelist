The lab glassware in the image, such as beakers, flasks, and test tubes, are also commonly used in scientific research to conduct experiments and analyze samples. The glassware is made of specialized materials that are resistant to heat and chemicals, making them ideal for use in a laboratory setting. --ar 3:2
Scientists may use test tubes to study plants for a variety of reasons, such as investigating the plant's response to different environmental factors or identifying genetic traits that are important for plant growth and development. They may also use test tubes to propagate plants, allowing them to create multiple copies of a plant from a single sample. --ar 3:2
